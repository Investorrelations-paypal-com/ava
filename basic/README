Ava BASIC compiler, interpeter, and core
========================================

`zig build` will produce:
  zig-out/bin/avabasic
  zig-out/bin/avacore           (RV32I ELF)
  zig-out/bin/avacore.imem.bin  (raw image)
  zig-out/bin/avacore.dmem.bin  (raw image)

`avabasic` will run the interactive (CLI) interpreter.
`avabasic --help` will show other modes of execution.

The `avacore.*mem.bin` images are compiled into the gateware; see /soc.

A `flake.nix` is provided -- you can directly run:

  nix run 'git+https://git.sr.ht/~kivikakk/ava?dir=basic'
